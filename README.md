## <a id="technology-stack">Technology Stack 💻📚</a>

### The application is built using the following technologies:

- React
- Redux Toolkit
- Axios
- TypeScript
- Webpack
- Sass
- ESLint
- Prettier
- Husky
- Jest

## <a id="scripts">Scripts</a>

<code>npm run start</code>: This script starts the development server using Webpack in
development mode. It serves the application and automatically opens it in the default web browser.

<code>npm run build</code>: The build script uses Webpack to bundle the application in production mode,
generating optimized and minified output files for deployment.

<code>npm run lint</code>: The lint script runs ESLint for coding style and potential errors.

<code>npm run prettier</code>: The format script uses Prettier to automatically format
files.

<code>npm run test</code>: This script runs the test suite using Jest, executing all test files in the project to ensure
proper
functionality and identify potential issues.

<code>npm run prepare</code>: The prepare script is triggered automatically when you run npm install. It installs Husky,
which sets up Git hooks for running tasks like linting and testing before committing or pushing code.

These scripts help streamline the development process and maintain code quality by enforcing linting, formatting, and
testing practices. Husky ensures that code quality checks are executed before committing, while Jest provides a robust
testing framework to validate the application's functionality.

## <a id="getting-started">Getting Started</a>

### To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository URL]`.
2. Ask the [Authors](#authors) for access to the api.
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
4. Start the development server: `npm start`.
5. Do hacking.

## <a id="development">Development Process</a>

During the development process, our e-Commerce application was crafted by a dedicated team of three talented
individuals, each contributing their expertise and skills. Throughout the project, we followed an organized and
efficient development
process to ensure a seamless workflow and successful delivery of the application.

1. **Task Management**: We used `GitHub Project` as our project management tool to keep track of tasks and
   their progress. Tasks were organized into lists representing different stages (To Do, In Progress, Review & Testing,
   Done) and consisted of smaller subtasks for better granularity. Each team member was responsible for specific tasks.

2. **Collaborative Communication**: Communication was key to our team's success. We utilized `Discord` and `Google Meet`
   for real-time
   discussions, team meetings, and daily stand-up reports. Daily stand-ups allowed each team member to share their
   progress, identify any blockers, and coordinate efforts effectively. In addition, we utilized `Telegram` for
   quick and immediate communication, ensuring swift responses and addressing any urgent queries that arose during
   development.

3. **Version Control with Git**: We followed the Gitflow workflow to manage version control. The project repository had
   a `main` branch for stable releases and a `develop` branch for ongoing development. For each task, team members
   created feature branches from the `develop` branch, worked on the changes, and submitted pull requests for code
   review.

4. **Code Review and Collaboration**: Pull requests were an essential part of our development process. Each pull request
   underwent a thorough code review by team members before merging into the `develop` branch. This practice
   ensured code quality, consistency, and adherence to project standards.

5. **Husky for Git Hooks**: To maintain code quality and ensure a consistent codebase, we utilized Husky, a Git hook
   manager. With Husky, we automated tasks such as code formatting, linting, and running tests before each commit and
   push. This ensured that only clean and valid code was added to the repository.

## <a id="testing">Testing</a>

We utilized Just as our primary testing framework to ensure the reliability and stability of our e Commerce application.

We are proud to report that approximately `35%` of our application code is covered by unit tests. This substantial test
coverage allows us to identify and address potential issues early in the development process, resulting in a smoother
user experience and reduced chances of regressions.
